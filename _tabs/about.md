# Hi, I am Prason Pandey

I build things that help users have a better experience on web.

Currently working as an Associate DevOps Engineer at Reduct Nepal.

I enjoy watching football (Hala Madrid!) and reading in my free time. Check out my [readlist](#).

You can find me on [Twitter](#), [Github](#), and [LinkedIn](#), or reach me via [email](#).

Feel free to connect - I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaborations!
